# scripts Manifest

## Purpose
Operational utilities and developer scripts that complement the main bot workflow.

## Files
- `tools.py`: Assorted CLI helpers for inspecting queue state, seeding data, and running maintenance tasks. Review docstrings within the file before use.
- `run_checks.py`: Developer convenience script that refreshes `tracking/all_functions.txt` and executes the unit test suite (`python -m scripts.run_checks`).

## Operational Notes
- Scripts assume the project root is on `PYTHONPATH`; run them via `python -m scripts.tools ...` to ensure imports resolve.
- Add new scripts thoughtfullyâ€”prefer enriching existing CLIs to avoid a proliferation of one-off files.
