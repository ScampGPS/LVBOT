# Documentation Manifest

Active documentation lives in this directory. Historical reports and plans have
been moved to `archive/reports/`.

- `../refactor_plan.md` – detailed sequencing for the Telegram runtime refactor.
- `../refactor_roadmap.md` – milestone tracking for the broader architecture work.

This directory currently hosts only this manifest to preserve legacy references; add new planning
notes here if future initiatives require their own subdirectory.
