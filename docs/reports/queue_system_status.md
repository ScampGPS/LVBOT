# Queue System Status Report

## Recent Bug Fix (2025-07-22)

### Issue: Missing queue_booking_date in user context
- **Error**: `Missing queue_booking_date in user context` when selecting time in queue booking flow
- **Root Cause**: `_handle_future_date_selection` was storing date as `selected_date` but `_handle_queue_booking_time_selection` expected `queue_booking_date`
- **Fix**: Now storing the date with both keys to maintain compatibility

## Queue System Components

### 1. **Reservation Queue** âœ…
- File: `utils/reservation_queue.py`
- Stores reservations in `queue.json`
- Tracks status: pending â†’ scheduled â†’ completed/failed
- Full CRUD operations implemented

### 2. **Queue Booking Flow** âœ…
- Entry: "ðŸ“… Reserve after 48h" from Reserve menu
- Flow: Year â†’ Month â†’ Date â†’ Time â†’ Courts â†’ Confirm
- Fixed: Date context storage issue
- Stores all required data for scheduler

### 3. **Reservation Scheduler** âœ…
- File: `utils/reservation_scheduler.py`
- Runs in background thread
- Monitors queue every 15 seconds
- Executes bookings when 48h window opens
- Uses browser pool with direct URL navigation

### 4. **User Notifications** âœ…
- Fixed: Actual Telegram messages now sent (was just logging)
- Success/failure notifications after booking attempts
- Async/sync wrappers for thread safety

### 5. **Direct URL Integration** âœ…
- Queue bookings use direct URL navigation
- No timezone dropdown issues
- Correct form fields (client.firstName, etc.)
- Confirmation page detection

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the bot**:
   ```bash
   python3 telegram_tennis_bot.py
   ```

2. **Test queue booking**:
   - Send `/start` to bot
   - Click "ðŸŽ¾ Reserve Court"
   - Click "ðŸ“… Reserve after 48h"
   - Select year â†’ month â†’ date (>48h future)
   - Select time â†’ courts
   - Confirm reservation

3. **Verify queue entry**:
   - Click "ðŸ“‹ Queued Reservations" from main menu
   - Should see your pending reservation

4. **Check queue file**:
   ```bash
   cat queue.json | python3 -m json.tool
   ```

## Known Working Features

âœ… Queue booking flow (all steps)
âœ… Date storage fix applied
âœ… Scheduler running and monitoring
âœ… Direct URL navigation
âœ… Form filling with correct fields
âœ… Confirmation detection
âœ… User notifications

## Next Steps

1. Monitor scheduler execution when 48h window opens
2. Test with multiple users/reservations
3. Verify retry logic on failures
4. Performance testing with concurrent bookings
