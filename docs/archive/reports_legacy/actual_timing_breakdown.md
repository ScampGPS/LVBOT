# Actual 40.2s Timing Breakdown

## Where the Time Really Goes

### Your Calculation (Optimized Delays Only)
- Browser warm-up: 4s (pre-execution, not counted in 40.2s)
- Initial delay: 3-5s → actual 3.2s
- Mouse movements: 2s → actual 1.5s  
- Button approach: 1s → actual 0.6s
- After-click: 3s → actual 4s
- Confirmation wait: 3s → actual 3s
- **Subtotal**: ~12.3s

### The Missing 27.9s Comes From:

#### 1. Form Filling (17.4s total)
- First name typing: 3s
- Last name typing: 3s
- Phone fill: 1s
- Email typing: 10.4s (the killer!)

#### 2. Page Load Waits (not just delays)
- Wait for form selector: 1s
- Additional form wait: 0.8-1.6s after speed division

#### 3. Processing & Framework Overhead
- Finding time slot: 0.1s
- Submit button find: 0.1s
- Result extraction: ~1s
- AsyncBookingExecutor wrapper: ~3s
- Browser pool coordination: ~0.5s

#### 4. Pre-Submit Review
- Mouse movement: 0.5s
- Review pause: 2.5s (after speed division of 0.5-1.0s)

#### 5. Submit Process
- Button approach: 0.4s
- Click: 0.1s
- Initial wait: 1.5s

## The Real Breakdown

```
Initial delay:          3.2s  (8%)
Mouse movements:        1.5s  (4%)
Find & approach slot:   0.7s  (2%)
Click & page load:      5.0s  (12%)
Form filling:          17.4s  (43%)
  - Names: 6s
  - Phone: 1s
  - Email: 10.4s
Pre-submit review:      3.0s  (7%)
Submit process:         2.0s  (5%)
Confirmation wait:      3.0s  (7%)
Framework overhead:     4.4s  (11%)
------------------------
TOTAL:                 40.2s
```

## Why Email Takes So Long

Email field (msaulcampos@gmail.com = 21 chars):
- Base typing: 90-220ms per char ÷ 2.5 = 36-88ms
- 21 chars × ~60ms average = 1.26s just typing
- But with mistakes, corrections, pauses = 10.4s total

## The Hidden Time Sinks

1. **Form Filling (17.4s)** - Intentionally slow for human-like behavior
2. **Page Transitions (5s)** - Server response time, not configurable
3. **Framework Overhead (4.4s)** - AsyncBookingExecutor, browser pool management
4. **All the "small" waits** - They add up to significant time

## Key Insight

The configurable delays (mouse, approach, after-click, etc.) are only about 30% of total time. The majority is:
- Human-like typing (43%)
- Page loads/server response (12%)
- Framework overhead (11%)

This is why optimizing the delays saved "only" 17 seconds - they're not the biggest time consumers!
