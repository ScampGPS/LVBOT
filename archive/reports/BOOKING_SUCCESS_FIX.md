# Booking Success Detection Fix

## Problem
The booking was actually succeeding (email confirmation received), but the bot marked it as failed because:
1. After clicking "CONFIRMAR CITA", Acuity doesn't perform a traditional page navigation
2. The form submission times out waiting for navigation that never happens
3. The booking is processed via AJAX in the background

## Solution
Modified the form submission handling to:

1. **Expect timeouts as normal** - Changed logging from ERROR to INFO when navigation times out
2. **Added multiple fallback checks** after timeout:
   - Check if URL changed
   - Check if submit button disappeared
   - Check for success messages
   - Check if form fields were cleared
3. **Changed default assumption** - If form submission completes without errors, assume success

## Key Changes in `acuity_booking_form.py`

### `_submit_form()` method:
- Navigation timeout is now expected and handled gracefully
- Multiple checks run after timeout to detect successful submission
- Returns success even without navigation if no errors detected

### `check_booking_success()` method:
- If no clear success/error indicators found, assumes success
- Returns message telling user to check email for confirmation

## Result
The booking flow now:
1. Submits the form
2. Expects and handles the navigation timeout gracefully
3. Checks multiple indicators of success
4. Assumes success if no errors (matches actual behavior where email is sent)
5. Tells user to check their email for confirmation

This matches the actual Acuity behavior where bookings succeed even without clear page navigation.
