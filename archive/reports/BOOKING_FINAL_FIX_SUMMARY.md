# Final Booking Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Wrong Date in Booking URL
**Problem**: The booking was using the current datetime instead of the target date, resulting in URLs like:
- Wrong: `datetime/2025-07-22T09:00:00-06:00` (current date)
- Correct: `datetime/2025-07-23T09:00:00-06:00` (target date)

**Solution**: 
- Added `target_date` parameter to `AsyncBrowserPool.execute_parallel_booking()`
- Updated `PooledTennisExecutor` to pass the target date from config
- Changed from `datetime.now()` to `target_date` in the booking URL construction

### 2. Form Submission Timeout
**Problem**: After clicking "CONFIRMAR CITA", the form submission was waiting 30 seconds for navigation that never completed, causing a timeout error.

**Solution**: Improved form submission handling with multiple fallback checks:
- Reduced navigation timeout from 30s to 10s
- Added checks for soft navigation (URL changes)
- Check if submit button disappeared (indicating submission)
- Look for success messages on the page
- Continue even if navigation doesn't complete in traditional way

## Files Modified

1. **`utils/async_browser_pool.py`**
   - Added `target_date` parameter to `execute_parallel_booking()`
   - Uses provided date instead of `datetime.now()`

2. **`utils/pooled_tennis_executor.py`**
   - Passes `config.target_date` to browser pool method

3. **`utils/acuity_booking_form.py`**
   - Improved `_submit_form()` with multiple success detection methods
   - Reduced timeout and added fallback checks

## Result
The booking should now:
1. Navigate to the correct date
2. Handle form submission more gracefully, even if the Acuity system doesn't perform a traditional page navigation

## Next Steps
Test the booking flow again - it should complete successfully now!
