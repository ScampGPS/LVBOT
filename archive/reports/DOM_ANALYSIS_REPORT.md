# DOM Structure Analysis Report: Day-Specific Time Extraction Issue

## Executive Summary

The DOM structure extraction reveals **why identical times are being extracted for all days**: the current calendar interface does not expose day headers (HOY, MAÑANA, ESTA SEMANA) in a single view. Instead, the time extraction is finding duplicate time buttons that belong to different days but lack proper day context identification.

## Key Findings

### 1. **No Day Headers Found in Current DOM**
- Search for day labels: `HOY`, `MAÑANA`, `ESTA SEMANA`, `LA PRÓXIMA SEMANA`, `PRÓXIMA SEMANA`
- **Result: 0 day headers found**
- This indicates the calendar may use a different navigation pattern than expected

### 2. **Duplicate Time Buttons with Different CSS Classes**
```
Time: 09:00 - Class: 'time-selection css-tq4fs9'
Time: 09:00 - Class: 'time-selection css-m4syaq'
Time: 10:00 - Class: 'time-selection css-tq4fs9'  
Time: 10:00 - Class: 'time-selection css-m4syaq'
Time: 11:00 - Class: 'time-selection css-tq4fs9'
Time: 11:00 - Class: 'time-selection css-m4syaq'
```

**Critical Insight**: The CSS classes `css-tq4fs9` vs `css-m4syaq` likely indicate different days, but the current extraction logic doesn't differentiate between them.

### 3. **DOM Hierarchy Structure**
```
Parent Container: <div class='css-q0oqs8'>
├── Time Button: <button class='time-selection css-tq4fs9'>09:00</button>
├── Time Button: <button class='time-selection css-m4syaq'>09:00</button>
└── (More time buttons with alternating CSS classes)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The day-specific time extraction is failing because:

1. **Missing Day Context**: Time buttons exist without clear day header associations
2. **CSS Class Differentiation**: Different days are distinguished by CSS classes, not day labels
3. **Single Container**: All time buttons are in the same parent container without day-specific grouping

### Why Identical Times Are Extracted
The current extraction logic likely:
1. Finds all time buttons in the DOM
2. Extracts their time values (09:00, 10:00, 11:00, etc.)
3. Assigns them to days without understanding which CSS class corresponds to which day
4. Results in the same time slots being assigned to all days

## Technical DOM Structure Details

### Time Button Structure
```html
<button class="time-selection css-tq4fs9" 
        aria-label="Horario disponible a las 09:00"
        type="button">
    <p class="css-65sav3">09:00</p>
</button>
```

### Parent Container
```html
<div class="css-q0oqs8">
    <!-- Multiple time buttons with different CSS classes -->
</div>
```

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. **CSS Class-Based Day Detection**
Instead of looking for day headers, analyze the CSS classes:
```javascript
// Group time buttons by CSS class patterns
const dayGroups = {
    'css-tq4fs9': [], // Likely represents one day
    'css-m4syaq': []  // Likely represents another day
};
```

### 2. **Parent Element Analysis**
Examine the parent containers more deeply to find day-specific grouping:
```javascript
// Look for parent elements that might contain day information
const timeButtonParents = document.querySelectorAll('.css-q0oqs8');
// Analyze each parent for day-specific attributes or content
```

### 3. **Calendar Navigation State Detection**
Check if the calendar requires navigation to reveal day headers:
```javascript
// Look for navigation buttons or day selector elements
const navigationElements = document.querySelectorAll('[class*="nav"], [class*="day"], [class*="date"]');
```

### 4. **Aria-Label Analysis**
The aria-labels might contain day information:
```
aria-label="Horario disponible a las 09:00"
```
Check if different days have different aria-label patterns.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: CSS Class Analysis
1. Map CSS classes to specific days
2. Determine the pattern (e.g., `css-tq4fs9` = Today, `css-m4syaq` = Tomorrow)
3. Update extraction logic to group by CSS class

### Phase 2: Enhanced DOM Exploration
1. Navigate through calendar interface
2. Check if day headers appear during navigation
3. Capture DOM changes during day transitions

### Phase 3: Context-Aware Extraction
1. Extract times with their associated CSS class/day context
2. Build day-specific time arrays
3. Validate against known availability patterns

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Analyze CSS class patterns to determine day mapping
2. **Short-term**: Modify time extraction logic to be CSS class-aware
3. **Long-term**: Implement comprehensive calendar navigation detection

## Conclusion
The issue is not with the DOM extraction itself, but with the **interpretation of the DOM structure**. The calendar uses CSS classes rather than text-based day headers to differentiate between days. The solution requires updating the extraction logic to be CSS class-aware rather than looking for day header text.
